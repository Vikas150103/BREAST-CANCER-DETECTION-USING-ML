# BREAST-CANCER-DETECTION-USING-ML
This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning classifiers to detect breast cancer based on given features. The goal is to determine the most accurate model for classification.
Models Evaluated: Logistic Regression , Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes
Performance Metrics:
The models were compared based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC.
Key findings from our evaluation:
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed the highest accuracy (~98.6%) and AUC (~0.997).
Logistic Regression and SVM had perfect recall but slightly lower precision.
Na√Øve Bayes had the lowest overall performance among the models tested.
Technologies Used:
Python üêç
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
