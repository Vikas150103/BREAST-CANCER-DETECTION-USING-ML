# BREAST-CANCER-DETECTION-USING-ML
This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning classifiers to detect breast cancer based on given features. The goal is to determine the most accurate model for classification.

Models Evaluated: 
1.Logistic Regression 
2.Random Forest 
3.Support Vector 
4.Machine (SVM)
5.Gradient Boosting
6.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7.Na√Øve Bayes

Performance Metrics:
The models were compared based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC.

Key findings from our evaluation:

1.Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed the highest accuracy (~98.6%) and AUC (~0.997).
2.Logistic Regression and SVM had perfect recall but slightly lower precision.
3.Na√Øve Bayes had the lowest overall performance among the models tested.

Technologies Used:
1.Python üêç
2.Scikit-learn
3.Pandas & NumPy
3.Matplotlib & Seaborn
